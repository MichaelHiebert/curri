# curri

A CV / Resume generator that takes in a JSON file and spits out a compiled LaTeX PDF.

## Getting Started

1. Using `example.json` as a guide, construct a new file called `real.json` with all of your desired information.

2. Run the script:
```
python3 main.py
```
and, if/when prompted, execute `R` to complete the PDF compilation in silent mode.

3. View your PDF, called `output.pdf`, in the source folder.
